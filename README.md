# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project--Week-4-Coursera

##This is the course project for the week 4 Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

##Make sure to download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
##Please load the activity and feature info
##Loads both the training and test datasets; this will only keep those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
##Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset; this will also merge those columns with the dataset
##Merges the two datasets
##Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
##Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the mean value of each variable for each subject and activity match.

##The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
